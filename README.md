# push_swap

One of the School 42 learning projects. It is focused on becoming familiar with sorting alghorithms.
The goal is to effectively sort set of integers using two stacks and a set of operations, like push
element from one stack to another, swap first two elements or rotate stack.
It consists of two executables:

* **checker** - takes integer arguments and reads instructions on the standard output. Once read,
checker executes them and displays OK if integers are sorted. Otherwise, it will display KO.

* **push_swap** - calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest progam using
 Push_swap instruction language that sorts integer arguments received.

(More info can be found in the subject push_swap.en.pdf)

My program uses variation of quick sort algorithm, which was modified to work with stacks.
